BootstrapOptions:
  BlockSizes:           [3, 4, 5]     # Catch sequence risk. Really no reason to second guess 3/4/5 years blocks
  RegimeAwareness:      100%          # Smooth historical regime transitions, from 100% means use exactly the regime transitions to 0% means use regime sizes as the guide.
