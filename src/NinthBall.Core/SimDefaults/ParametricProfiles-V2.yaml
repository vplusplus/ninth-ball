    # Stocks Volatility 18% sets the standard market turbulence level without adding stress padding or optimism bias.

    # Stocks Skewness negative 0.3 and Kurtosis 3.5 captures empirically realistic tail risk without catastrophe modeling.
    # Inflation Mean 3% aligns with long-term structural inflation norms for a neutral forward-looking view.

  Original-parameters-keeping-for-reference:
    # When Stocks crash (panic), investors often sell stocks and buy Bonds (safe haven). 
    # This drives Stock prices down and Bond prices up, creating a negative correlation.
    # While this varies by decade (it was positive in the 1980s/90s), 
    # it has been structurally negative for most of the 21st century. 
    # -0.15 is a prudent estimate that acknowledges this benefit without overstating it.
    StocksBondCorrelation: -0.15

    # Stocks tend to struggle slightly when inflation rises unexpectedly (valuation compression).
    StocksInflationCorrelation: -0.2

    # Bonds hate inflation (yields rise, prices fall). This linkage is weak but generally positive
    # in terms of yields (negative for prices). 
    # However, for annual real returns, bonds often struggle during inflation spikes.
    # A slight negative or near-zero correlation is safer for stress testing. 
    # But technically, high inflation usually hurts nominal bond returns -> prices drop.
    # Let's use a conservative negative correlation to model "bad times happen together".
