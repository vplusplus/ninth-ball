# NOTE: NoBackToBackOverlaps is off by default.
# Enabling NoBackToBackOverlaps resamples 389 of 91,966 blocks across 10,000 iterations. 
# That is less than 0.5%. No change in Survival Rate.
# This is not a needle mover, neither does it materially interfere with sampling behavior.

MovingBlockBootstrapOptions:
  BlockSizes:           [3, 4, 5]     # Catch sequence risk. Really no reason to second guess 3/4/5 years blocks
  NoBackToBackOverlaps: false         # Avoids sampling back-to-back overlapping blocks with extreme outcome. 
  RegimeAwareness:      25%           # 100% (1.0): Use learnt regime transitions | 0% (0.0): Use regime sizes as the guide.
