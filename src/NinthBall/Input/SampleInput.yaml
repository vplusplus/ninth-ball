  # When Stocks crash (panic), investors often sell stocks and buy Bonds (safe haven). 
  # This drives Stock prices down and Bond prices up, creating a negative correlation.
  # While this varies by decade (it was positive in the 1980s/90s), 
  # it has been structurally negative for most of the 21st century. 
  # -0.15 is a prudent estimate that acknowledges this benefit without overstating it.

  # Stocks tend to struggle slightly when inflation rises unexpectedly (valuation compression).
  StocksInflationCorrelation: -0.20 

  # Bonds hate inflation (yields rise, prices fall). This linkage is weak but generally positive 
  # in terms of yields (negative for prices). 
  # However, for annual real returns, bonds often struggle during inflation spikes.
  # A slight negative or near-zero correlation is safer for stress testing. 
  # But technically, high inflation usually hurts nominal bond returns -> prices drop.
  # Let's use a conservative negative correlation to model "bad times happen together".
