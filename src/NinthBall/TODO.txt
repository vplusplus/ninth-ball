* Excel readers are in two places. Consider moving the logic to a 'Reader'.
* Add whitebox unit tests 
* Implement reallocation strategy: Can change allocation from 50-50 to 60-40 to 70-30 at specific years.

Q Should we package initial parameters to SimParams? 
  Currently these are passed around as individual parameters.
  Motivation is, common parameters not specific to individual objectives are captured as SimParams.

* IDEA: 
  Implement stochastic gradient descent by sunning multiple simulations to discover parameters.
  Example: For given set of objectives, discover minimum required initial balance for 99% success
  Example: For given set of objectives, discover safe withdawal amount
  Example: For given set of objectives, discover minimum required buffer amount 99% success
  Example: For given set of objectives, discover if investing buffer cash can improve survival
