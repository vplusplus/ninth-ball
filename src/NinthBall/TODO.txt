* Excel readers are in two places. Consider moving the logic to a 'Reader'.
* Add whitebox unit tests 
* Implement reallocation strategy: Can change allocation from 50-50 to 60-40 to 70-30 at specific years.
* Accept iterationIndex[] parameter in Output specification. Print iteration data in addition to known percentiles
* Externalize list of percentiles shown in the output report to config yaml file. Example: Output: Percentiles: [0.1, 0.05, 0.2, ...]

* Revisit use of decimals to represent percentage. Consider 1-100. Keep it consistent.
* Consider using suffix Pct for all percentages represented on -100 to +100. Currently its mixed.

Q Should we package initial parameters to SimParams? 
  Currently these are passed around as individual parameters.
  Motivation is, common parameters not specific to individual objectives are captured as SimParams.

* IDEA: 
  Implement stochastic gradient descent by sunning multiple simulations to discover parameters.
  Example: For given set of objectives, discover minimum required initial balance for 99% success
  Example: For given set of objectives, discover safe withdawal amount
  Example: For given set of objectives, discover minimum required buffer amount 99% success
  Example: For given set of objectives, discover if investing buffer cash can improve survival
  
* IDEA:
  Integrate with LLM to describe the result.
  Generate HtML report, ask LLM to describe, include in the report.

* IDEA:
  Package as self-contained asp.net razor pages exe that initiates a broser.
  Provides UI for updating the objevtives and see the result.

* IDEA:
  Instead of generating static html, produce data.
  Implement a self-contained Razor pages to view the report.
